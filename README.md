# TestingWorld
A public repository that will be used to highlight various tools and technologies that I am trying to learn

Currently, I am working on the following items:
* Using Github Actions
    * Tested: GH Actions to confirm ECR Access (r/w)
    * Working: Snyk Security Scanning
    * Working: Dependabot Scanning
* Building Docker Containers
    * Tested: Simple python based container
* Building Python Scripts
    * Tested: Simple scripts to return strings
* Build a "Hello World" Demo in Go
    * Tested: Able to run locally

TO DO:
* Figure out a template language to play with (jinja-based?)
    ** sceptre is an option (for use with CloudFormation)
        ** this would prove to be a good choice as I could get practice at work too
* Investigate cool projects I can play with using TrueNAS Core
    * Fuck you - get heatmap update
